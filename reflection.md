# Project Reflection

## What advice would you give yourself if you were to start a project like this again?
Try to do the most time consuming protions of the project at the same time. For this project this refers to the floodfill and classes. By completing These time consuming portions of the project at the same time I would not only be able to save time and complete my "Needs to Have" list faster but also work more on my "Nice to Have" list. Due to the long periods of  time with little to no progress my motivation would decrease rapidly. If I had completed them quicker I would have had both the motivation and the time to add some fun details that may not have been on my lists.

## Did you complete everything in your "needs to have" list?
Yes, although some sections were not completely up to my standards and I wish I had done them better I did complete the list. For example, I did my best to center the canvas but due to the only solution I found being translating the grid the mouse would be messed up. Therefore, I decided it best to only center the screen at the end.

## What was the hardest part of the project?
The hardest part of the project was likely the floodfill and the classes. The concept of floodfill seemed simple when I was reading and researching about it, but was a completely different world when I tried to implement it. I ended up asking both Erika and Angela to help me look through the code during the Winter break to no avail. Eventually, with Mr. Schellenberg's help it was fixed. The classes were rather difficult as I had to modify the pre written functions and create function where they would be set up and can later be called. Within these classes was also the numbering of the image. The process of making sure there were the right number of values pushed into the array took a long time with some images. 

## Were there any problems I could not solve?
I don't believe there were many major problems that I could not solve. Some problems I could not solve on my own but with the help of others they were debugged and solved. There was a minor issue that I chose not to solve which was translating the mouse alongside the grid.
