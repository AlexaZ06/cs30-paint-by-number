# Project Description

My project will be creating a paint/colour by number with images of my choice and if I have time I would like to be able to have the person upload an image themselves and colour in that image.

## Need to Have List
- Start screen
- Multiple images (at least 8)
- Screen with images to choose to colour
- End screen
- Image pixalated in grid
- Click to change colour of grid on only the correct bricks
- Identify colours and assign them to keys or maybe make buttons with the colours (should cover all colours)
- Center canvas in screen
- Assign numbers to colours (should account for any colour)
- Flood fill to make colouring faster

## Nice to have List 
- Music that coresponds to the image or you can choose a song to play
- Traslucent colour over block of wrong colour if you click on it
- Image pixelator
- Place to upload files and process users image of choice
- Help button/explination button 
- Ability for user to pick the grid size
