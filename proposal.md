# Project Description

My project will be creating a paint/colour by number with images of my choice and if I have time I would like to be able to have the person upload an image themselves and colour in that image.

## Need to Have List
- Start screen/screen with images to choose to colour✓
- Multiple images (at least 8)✓
- End screen✓
- Image pixalated in grid✓
- Click to change colour of grid on only the correct bricks✓
- Identify colours and assign them to keys or maybe make buttons with the colours (should cover all colours)✓
- Center canvas in screen (only did so for the end screen as couldn't find a way other than translate, which messes with the mouse)✓
- Assign numbers to colours (should account for any colour)✓
- Flood fill to make colouring faster✓
- Music that coresponds to the image or you can choose music✓

## Nice to have List 
- Traslucent colour over block of wrong colour if you click on it
- Image pixelator✓
- Place to upload files and process users image of choice
- Help button/explination button✓/2
- Ability for user to pick the grid size
